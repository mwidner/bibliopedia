Welcome

 Welcome to Bibliopedia, a digital tool for humanistic research that will make the web of scholarly literature easy to browse, to edit, and in which to discover new works. Please read our About page for detailed information. Thanks to generous support from the NEH, we've moved from our initial research phase into developing a working prototype. We're hard at work building the infrastructure, installing software, researching semantic knowledgebases, and generally getting things done.  To see (most) of our code, aside from the Drupal details, visit our GitHub repository.
